{"name":"Bson.ml","tagline":"bson ocaml mongodb ","body":"# Bson.ml\r\n\r\n**Bson.ml** is an ocaml implementation for MongoDB BSON protocol. \r\n\r\nIt includes a Bson document data structure to be used with ocmal, together with BSON's encoding (to bytes) and decoding (from bytes). \r\n\r\nHere is its [api doc](http://massd.github.io/bson/doc/Bson.html)\r\n### Usage in a functional way\r\n\r\nThe logic of **usage** is like this\r\n\r\n1. Create an empty Bson document\r\n2. Create the elements you want\r\n3. Add elements to the document with names\r\n4. Or remove elements from the document via the names\r\n5. Get elements from the document via the names\r\n6. After obtaining an element, get the raw value from the element\r\n\r\nThe functions inside this module seem to be many, however, most of them are just for creating elements. These functions are to *hide the implementation details of the type elements*. Also, in this way, the Bson document can be used more safely.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n###Sample code\r\n\r\n\tlet doc = Bson.make ();;\r\n\tlet element = Bson.create_string \"world\";;\r\n\tlet new_doc = Bson.add_element \"hello\" element doc;;\r\n\r\n\tlet encoded_bytes = Bson.encode new_doc;;\r\n\tlet decoded_doc = Bson.decode encoded_bytes;;\r\n\r\n***\r\n### Taste Bson.ml\r\n\r\nIn order to taste Bson.ml, please have a look at test/test_bson.ml. \r\nYou can use the following command in the root of the project to run it:\r\n\r\n\tocamlbuild -I src test/test_bson.native\r\n\t./test_bson.native \r\n\r\n***\r\n###Ocamlfind support\r\n\r\nThe META file is supplied in the root of project. Also the _build folder is provided together with the source.\r\n\r\nIf you want to directly use it as a library via ocamlfind, please do\r\n\r\n\tocamlfind install bson META _build/src/bson.cmo _build/src/bson.cmx src/bson.mli\r\n***\r\n### Further information\r\nPlease refer to the [Official Bson specification](http://bsonspec.org/#/specification) for more information.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to [this excellent answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/8665591/298143) for more information about \"how to let ocamlfind to find your lib\"\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\nThe current version is 0.88.0\r\n\r\nYes, I would like to call this utility as Bson.ml instead of ocamlbson, or something like that.\r\n\r\nIn addition, experienced ocaml developers are welcomed to improve the code base","google":"UA-40567510-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
